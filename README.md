## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world startup risk assessment model. It includes:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Training classification models (Logistic Regression baseline)
- Logging experiments with **MLflow**
- Saving models and results
- (Future) CI/CD setup for automatic retraining & deployment

## 🎯 Goal

Predict whether a startup will succeed or fail based on features like:

- Funding amount
- Startup age
- Number of founders
- Industry sector
- Location

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- MLflow
- Google Colab
- YAML
- CI/CD (Optional: Streamlit / Docker / GitHub Actions)

## ▶️ How to Run

#### In Google Colab:

1. Open `notebooks/startup_success.ipynb`
2. Follow the cells to load data, train model, and track experiments

#### Locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 📊 MLflow Tracking Example

Each training run is logged with:

- Model parameters (`log_param`)
- Metrics (`accuracy`, `f1_score`)
- Model artifact
- Custom tags (e.g. "experiment version", "model type")

Launch MLflow UI:
```bash
mlflow ui
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000` to explore results.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Enable real-time data ingestion (e.g., from Crunchbase)
- Integrate SHAP or LIME for explainability
- Deploy model with Streamlit or FastAPI

## 🧠 Business Problem

Early-stage startups face high failure rates, and investors often rely on gut feeling or incomplete data.  
This project aims to build a predictive ML model that estimates the probability of success or failure for startups,  
based on business attributes such as:

- Total funding
- Number of founders
- Industry sector
- Location
- Startup age

### 🎯 Business Value

- Help investors make smarter, data-driven funding decisions  
- Support accelerators in evaluating applicants  
- Enable founders to benchmark their own startup’s risk profile
